For all the results presented in the paper related to Gaussian score, go to the Gaussian folder. '
use the file check_pvalue to get the empirical size and the power curve. The results are obtained from
the henry2 simulation cluster, which is LSF based machine. Need to run the workflow_herny2 file 
to get those results.

For all the results presented in the paper related to Non-Gaussian score, go to the MixGaussian folder. '
use the file check_pvalue to get the empirical size and the power curve. The results are obtained from
the henry2 simulation cluster, which is LSF based machine. Need to run the workflow_herny2* files 
to get those results.

PS: Do not run the entire workflow_henr2 file at once, as it will take a long time to finish!
